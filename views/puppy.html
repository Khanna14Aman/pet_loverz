            <p class="card-text">A January 2017 study found that puppies respond when humans speak in sing-song tones, but adult dogs couldn’t care less. Researchers from the University of Lyon at Saint-Etienne found that people speak more slowly and at a much higher pitch when talking to puppies (or pictures of them, at least) than when talking to humans or adult dogs. When the researchers played recordings of participants’ puppy talk to dogs, they found that the puppies showed greater responses to the cooing than to recordings of humans using their regular (human-directed) voices.</p>

            <p class="card-text">Looking at cute pictures of puppies at work is more productive than you’d think. In a 2012 study, Japanese researchers found that viewing pictures of puppies made people better at tasks that required close attention. Viewing pictures of older dogs, however, was not as effective. People were more effective and more careful in accomplishing the tasks before them if they were flooded by the positive emotions of seeing an amazingly adorable baby animal. The researchers suggest that maybe people should look at cute things before driving or at work to help them focus..</p>

            <p class="card-text">In a Hungarian study published in 2005, researchers found that pet puppies show specific attachments to the humans that care for them. While even wolves that had been hand-raised from birth by humans didn’t show any preference for the people that raised them—they reacted the same way to strangers as to the caregivers they had spent their entire lives with—domestic puppies as young as 4 months old showed a significant preference to their owners. They followed and greeted their owners more than they did strange humans, and when their owner left, they tended to stand by the door waiting for them to return. This difference was observed in both puppies that had been hand-raised with extensive socialization and puppies that had been reared in a litter by their mothers, indicating that as a species, dogs have evolved to bond with their human owners..</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">PUPPIES</h5>
            <p class="card-text">When they’re first born, puppies only respond to warmth, touch, and smell. Their eyes remain closed, and they can’t hear. Puppies don’t fully develop the ability to hear until they are 4 weeks old, and it is not until 6 weeks of age, on average, that they develop full vision. Once their senses develop, they begin exploring the world in earnest, beginning a critical period of socialization..</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">PUPPIES</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Puppies don’t all develop on the same timeline. A 2015 study of almost 100 purebred dogs found that different breeds of dogs develop a sense of fear at different times in puppyhood. The researchers put puppies from 4 weeks old to 10 weeks old through several tests designed to provoke a fear response, like making them listen to a loud bang or explore a seesaw. They found that Cavalier King Charles spaniels didn’t show fear-related behavior (like crouching down) until later than German shepherds or Yorkshire terriers....<br><br>While German shepherds typically began showing a fear response around 35 days old, the spaniels didn’t start avoiding scary stimuli until 55 days old.</p>

            <p class="card-text">Dogs aren’t born with very moist eyes. One 2012 study found that 4-week-old puppies do produce basal tears, but in much smaller quantities than adult dogs. Their eyes get wetter every day, finally reaching adult levels of tears at about 10 weeks old. By contrast, full-term human babies have eyes which are just as wet as those of adults, unless they’re born premature, in which case they have lower secretions of tears until a few weeks later. (These are just the tears that keep eyes moist, not the psychological kind.)..<br>In 2016, a veterinarian encountered what is thought to be the first verified instance of identical twin puppies. When South African vet Kurt de Cramer performed a C-section on a pregnant Irish wolfhound, he discovered that two male puppies shared the same placenta. Later, he had their DNA tested and confirmed that they were, in fact, identical twins..</p>
